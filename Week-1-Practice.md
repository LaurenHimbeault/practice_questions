Java Basics
===========


Easier
------

1. Create a Java program **Weather.java**. This program should create a variable *double celsius*, then calculate and print out it's farenheit value. The formula needed can be found on google. For an extra challenge, you can try using Scanner(System.in) if you want to use input instead of a predefined hard-coded value.

2. Create a Java Program **Shaps.java**. This program should print shapes usings \*'s. Write as many methods as you feel you need for clean code. You must use loops to complete the activities.
Try to get your program to print the following shapes:
```
****
****
****
****

* * * *
* * * *
* * * *


		    ***
		   *****
		  *******
		   *****
		    ***
*
* *
* * * 
* * * *
* * * * *
```

3. Create a program that asks the user to input a number repeatedly. Each time the user inputs a number, add it to a variable *sum*. Keep prompting the user for numbers and adding them until the user enters a 0. This should stop the program and print out the sum of the numbers. You may assume no more than 100 numbers will be entered however the program must stop if a 0 is entered (even before the 100th number). You may assume the user will enter valid integers.

Bonus: Keep a history of all the numbers the user enters and print that out as well


Challenge
---------

1. Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters but in a different order. Here are a few examples of anagram pairs:
```
	listen & silent
	tip & pit
	Paris & pairs
```

Write a program that checks if two words are anagrams. You can use methods or not, that is up to you.

As an added challenge, for a given array of strings, return separate lists that group anagrams together. For example, the input {“tar,” “rat,” “art,” “meats,” “steam”}, the output should look something like {[“tar,” “rat,” “art”], [“meats,” “steam”]}.

3. A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. For example, 7 is a prime number because it’s only divisible by 1 and 7.

Create a function that returns TRUE if an input number is prime. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.

For a slightly harder challenge, create a prime number calculator that outputs all prime numbers between 2 and the input number.
