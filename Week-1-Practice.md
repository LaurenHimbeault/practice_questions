Java Basics
===========

1. Create a Java program **Weather.java**. This program should create a variable *double celsius*, then calculate and print out it's farenheit value. The formula needed can be found on google. For an extra challenge, you can try using Scanner(System.in) if you want to use input instead of a predefined hard-coded value.

2. Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters but in a different order. Here are a few examples of anagram pairs:
```
	listen & silent
	tip & pit
	Paris & pairs
```

Write a program that checks if two words are anagrams. You can use methods or not, that is up to you.

As an added challenge, for a given array of strings, return separate lists that group anagrams together. For example, the input {“tar,” “rat,” “art,” “meats,” “steam”}, the output should look something like {[“tar,” “rat,” “art”], [“meats,” “steam”]}.

3. A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. For example, 7 is a prime number because it’s only divisible by 1 and 7.

Create a function that returns TRUE if an input number is prime. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.

For a slightly harder challenge, create a prime number calculator that outputs all prime numbers between 2 and the input number.
